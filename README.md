<h3>How it works.</h3>
Example:<br />
Movie: {:title Project Nim, :rating 1033}

<p />
<dl>
	<dt>Project Nim</dt>
<dd>
	<dl>
	<dt>Rating = </dt>
	<dd>Sum of <br />
	[critic_rating] +
	<br />
	[viewer_rating] +
	<br />
	[related_videos_critic_rating] + (No more than 40 related movies)
	<br />
	[related_videos_viewer_rating] + (No more than 40 related movies)
	</dd>
	</dl>
</dd>

<h3>Why it works.</h3>
<b>Good movies are not like, similar, and or related to bad movies.</b>
<br />
A good movie will probably be like, similar, and or related to other good movies.<br />
Calculating the rank of up to 40 relationships per movie can help weed out the bad from the good.
